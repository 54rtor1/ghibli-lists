Very simple application to exercise my ORM (Active Record) skills, CRUD (although opted for not adding an update action) and MVC pattern on rails. 
Three models were generated: a movie model, a list and a bookmark. The bookmark works as a joint table and receives the foreign keys from movies and lists, making it possible to add movies on list. I also played with some cool tools like Typed.Js using Stimulus.
